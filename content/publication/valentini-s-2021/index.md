abstract: Most experimental claims of Majorana bound states, unusual quasiparticles
  that may become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing, rest on the observation
  of a persistent zero bias peak (ZBP) in tunneling spectra. In semiconductor–superconductor
  heterostructures, this feature may also be caused by the topologically trivial Andreev
  bound states. Valentini et al. provide comprehensive evidence that the ZBPs observed
  in their experiments with semiconductor nanowires fully coated with a superconducting
  shell are indeed of this topologically trivial origin, in contrast to the interpretation
  of similar earlier experiments. The researchers identify the length of the tunnel
  junction in their devices as a crucial experimental parameter. Science, abf1513,
  this issue p. 82 Tunneling into devices made of InAs nanowires fully wrapped with
  superconducting Al reveals the character of subgap states. A semiconducting nanowire
  fully wrapped by a superconducting shell has been proposed as a platform for obtaining
  Majorana modes at small magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate that the
  appearance of subgap states in such structures is actually governed by the junction
  region in tunneling spectroscopy measurements and not the full-shell nanowire itself.
  Short tunneling regions never show subgap states, whereas longer junctions always
  do. This can be understood in terms of quantum dots forming in the junction and
  hosting Andreev levels in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime. The intricate magnetic field
  dependence of the Andreev levels, through both the Zeeman and Little-Parks effects,
  may result in robust zero-bias peaks—features that could be easily misinterpreted
  as originating from Majorana zero modes but are unrelated to topological superconductivity.
